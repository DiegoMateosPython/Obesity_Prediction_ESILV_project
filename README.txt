In conclusion of this study, we finally manage to get a 79% of accuracry while predicting the target and 93% of accuracy while predicting if a person is obese or not.​
We maybe could even better results if the mistakes/problems in the inital dataset were fixed. ​
We enjoyed working on these data because it's a concrete use case of data science and about a subject on which everyone has knowledge.
